# Installation

2. From this folder run `julia --project INSTALL_DEPENDENCES.jl`

# Usage

Use `portfolio_constructor.ipynb` to construct the portfolio. This notebook is heavily commented and, I hope, understandable. The notebook `portfolio_viewer.ipynb` does not have a lot of comments. Its purpose is to be a playground where you can do something with the portfolio generated earlier.
